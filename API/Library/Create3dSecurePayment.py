"""Create 3D Secure payment (PHP Library)

3D Secure (Verifed by VISA / MasterCard SecureCodeâ„¢) is an additional authentication
protocol that involves the shopper being redirected to their card issuer where their
identity is authenticated prior to the payment proceeding to an authorisation request.

In order to start processing 3D Secure transactions, the following changes are required:
1. Your Merchant Account needs to be confgured by Adyen to support 3D Secure. If you would
   like to have 3D Secure enabled, please submit a request to the Adyen Support Team (support@adyen.com).
2. Your integration should support redirecting the shopper to the card issuer and submitting
   a second API call to complete the payment.

This example demonstrates the initial API call to create the 3D secure payment using Python Library,
and shows the redirection the the card issuer.
See the API Manual for a full explanation of the steps required to process 3D Secure payments.

A payment can be submitted by sending a PaymentRequest to the authorise action of the web service.
The initial API call for both 3D Secure and non-3D Secure payments is almost identical.
However, for 3D Secure payments, you must supply the browserInfo object as a sub-element of the payment request.
This is a container for the acceptHeader and userAgent of the shopper's browser.

The request should contain the following variables:

- merchantAccount           : The merchant account for which you want to process the payment
- amount
    - currency              : The three character ISO currency code.
    - value                 : The transaction amount in minor units (e.g. EUR 1,00 = 100).
- reference                 : Your reference for this payment.
- shopperIP                 : The shopper's IP address. (recommended)
- shopperEmail              : The shopper's email address. (recommended)
- shopperReference          : An ID that uniquely identifes the shopper, such as a customer id. (recommended)
- fraudOffset               : An integer that is added to the normal fraud score. (optional)
- card
    - expiryMonth           : The expiration date's month written as a 2-digit string,
                              padded with 0 if required (e.g. 03 or 12).
    - expiryYear            : The expiration date's year written as in full (e.g. 2016).
    - holderName            : The card holder's name, as embossed on the card.
    - number                : The card number.
    - cvc                   : The card validation code, which is the CVC2 (MasterCard),
                              CVV2 (Visa) or CID (American Express).
- billingAddress (recommended)
    - street                : The street name.
    - houseNumberOrName     : The house number (or name).
    - city                  : The city.
    - postalCode            : The postal/zip code.
    - stateOrProvince       : The state or province.
    - country               : The country in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format (e.g. NL).
- browserInfo
    - userAgent             : The user agent string of the shopper's browser (required).
    - acceptHeader          : The accept header string of the shopper's browser (required).

Once your account is confgured for 3-D Secure, the Adyen system performs a directory
inquiry to verify that the card is enrolled in the 3-D Secure programme.
If it is not enrolled, the response is the same as a normal API authorisation.
If, however, it is enrolled, the response contains these fields:

- paRequest     : The 3-D request data for the issuer.
- md            : The payment session.
- issuerUrl     : The URL to direct the shopper to.
- resultCode    : The resultCode will be RedirectShopper.

The paRequest and md fields should be included in an HTML form, which needs to be submitted
using the HTTP POST method to the issuerUrl. You must also include a termUrl parameter
in this form, which contains the URL on your site that the shopper will be returned to
by the issuer after authentication. In this example we are redirecting to another example
which completes the 3D Secure payment.

@see  API/Library/Authorise3dSecurePayment.py

We recommend that the form is "self-submitting" with a fallback in case javascript is disabled.
A sample form is shown below.
